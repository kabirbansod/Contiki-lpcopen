 * Implementation of the rtimer module for the lpc1347
 *
 * Use the Repetitive Interrupt Timer (RI-Timer) since it is always running.
 * It is a 48 bit timer running from the main clock.
 * The timer is configured so that it only uses 32 bit. Otherwise the following
 * lines in contiki-conf.h must be changed to use 64 bit types:
 *
 * typedef uint32_t rtimer_clock_t;
 * #define RTIMER_CLOCK_LT(a,b)     ((int32_t)((a)-(b)) < 0)
 *
 * At 32bit the maximum interval is 2^32 / CLK. At 72MHz it is about 59 seconds.
